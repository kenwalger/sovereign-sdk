# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Retry Sequence Ledger Collision**: Corrected an api-level architectural bug where failed dispatches left the tracking index frozen. `execution_depth` now increments unconditionally for every single dispatch transaction attempt, completely preventing cryptographic index collisions or duplicate ledger positions during external loop recovery cycles.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Symmetric CLI Failure Signaling**: Integrated strict termination controls across all CLI code paths inside `__main__.py`. Single-tool mode invocations now cleanly mirror the pipeline execution path by forcing an explicit non-zero exit status (`click.Abort()`) upon runtime faults, completely eliminating silent error masking.
- **Isolated Standalone Diagnostic Hydration**: Enhanced `analyze_stored_data` to gracefully intercept standalone debugging operations. If an empty execution boundary is detected, the runtime fallback-hydrates a baseline diagnostic telemetry stream, keeping standalone CLI options functional for out-of-band testing.

### Fixed
- **Ledger Sequence Collision**: Corrected an off-by-one ledger depth assignment flaw within `LocalRuntimeRouter.dispatch`. Stamping indices are now securely locked down *prior* to successful tool mutations, ensuring chronological integrity (`0`-indexed tracking) and preventing signature index duplication across success-to-failure state handoffs.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Forensic Receipt Depth Collision**: Fixed an off-by-one ledger assignment where `execution_depth` was captured post-mutation. Stamped index allocations are now secured prior to state updates, preserving unique timeline signatures across success/failure transitions.
- **Standalone CLI Invocation Context**: Upgraded `analyze_stored_data` to support standalone context exploration options, fallback-hydrating diagnostic baselines smoothly to prevent standalone invocation crashes.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Asymmetric CLI Failure Reporting**: Resolved a telemetry reporting gap by introducing explicit validation checks within the single-tool CLI execution path inside `__main__.py`. Single tool failures now print the forensic receipt and cleanly terminate with a non-zero exit status (`Aborted!`), ensuring visibility across containerized and shell orchestrators.
- **Tracking Metrics Integrity**: Reinforced `execution_depth` handling inside `router.py` to prevent post-increment capture pollution, keeping transactional session indexes stable across variable failure scenarios.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Pipeline Failure Obscurity**: Implemented fail-fast circuit evaluation inside `__main__.py`. Upstream receipts are now immediately verified post-dispatch, gracefully aborting execution chains on failures and preventing misleading downstream errors.
- **Dead Fallback Elimination**: Streamlined `_calculate_stable_arguments_hash` inside `router.py` by removing redundant `try/except` error routing since string serialization coercion is covered natively via `default=str`.


## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Public Key Serialization Encoding**: Resolved a `TypeError` crash in `SovereignKeyManager.get_base64_public_key` by ensuring public key raw byte extractions consume a valid `PublicFormat.Raw` enumeration parameter rather than a private key formatter target.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Core Receipt Instability**: Eradicated the final remaining instance of Python's process-unstable `hash()` call inside `SovereignKeyManager.generate_receipt` (`crypto.py`). Upgraded `payload_hash` generation to use a deterministic SHA-256 hex digest to ensure forensic receipts are cross-process stable.


## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Session State Leakage**: Fixed a side-effect bug where `execution_depth` was incremented before tool completion. State mutations now deferred until post-execution confirmation, preventing counter inflation on tool exceptions.
- **CLI Configuration Regression**: Restored dynamic Click terminal configuration bindings (`--tool`, `--resource-id`, `--session-id`) across the async runtime architecture, removing hardcoded script blocks.
- **Dead Import Pruning**: Stripped out an unused `SovereignKeyManager` dependency declaration from `__main__.py`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Process Hash Instability**: Eliminated Python's native `hash()` function inside `LocalRuntimeRouter.dispatch` due to runtime seed volatility. Replaced it with a canonical, key-sorted SHA-256 hex-digest loop.
- **Complex Argument Type Crash**: Resolved an unhashable `TypeError` regression when passing complex data arrays (`lists`, `dicts`) to runtime tools by using JSON serialization schemas prior to hashing.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-20

### Security
- **Exposed Secret Remediation**: Excluded the `.keys/` cryptographic directory from version control tracking inside `.gitignore` and untracked compromised development certificates.

### Fixed
- **Wildcard Import Runtime Crash**: Fixed a `TypeError` in `sovereign_core.__init__` by casting the `SessionContext` object inside `__all__` to a compliant string literal.
- **Forensic Hash Regression**: Restored the `arguments_hash` generation step inside the asynchronous `LocalRuntimeRouter` pipeline to prevent duplicate receipt structural hashes across varying parameter executions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Asynchronous Execution Architecture**: Upgraded the execution pipeline within `LocalRuntimeRouter` to handle non-blocking, cooperative concurrent tool patterns via `asyncio`.
- **Stateful Session Primitives**: Introduced the `SessionContext` model to track ephemeral state variables, variable scoping, and sequential transaction counts (`execution_depth`) across tool chains.
- **Inter-Tool Data Dependency Support**: Validated state mutation flows where secondary tools seamlessly digest and process outputs cached in volatile memory by preceding tools within the same execution session.

### Changed
- **Pipeline Signatures**: Modified the router verification mechanism to embed `session_id` and transactional metrics cleanly inside the finalized cryptographic payload receipts.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Cryptography Implementation**: Added `sovereign_core.crypto` featuring native `cryptography` library integration for asymmetric Ed25519 key derivation.
- **Identity Persistence**: Added secure on-disk keypair caching inside a restricted `.keys/` directory (with `0o600` file permissions) to persist node identities across runtime restarts.
- **Forensic Verification Ledger**: Implemented `ForensicReceipt` (`TypedDict`) payload minting and a strict `ReceiptSchema` validation layer via Pydantic to ensure provenance integrity.
- **Local Dispatch Router**: Created `LocalRuntimeRouter` in `sovereign_runtime.router` to securely register local tool routines, wrap execution outputs, and map immutable cryptographic signatures over results.
- **Interactive CLI Context**: Updated the main executable entry-point (`sovereign-node`) to demonstrate a complete mock payload hash dispatch and automated receipt logging directly to the console.

### Fixed
- **Build Backend Alignment**: Shifted child workspaces from `hatchling` to `setuptools` to completely mitigate editable-link mapping failures (`build_editable` exceptions) within virtual workspaces.
- **Package Layout Discovery**: Added explicit `src-layout` path tracking configuration under `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` to resolve `ModuleNotFoundError` anomalies on Windows runtime environments.
- **Namespace Cleanups**: Streamlined internal eager imports inside package `__init__.py` files, eliminating stale placeholder structures (`IngestionBoundary`, `PreFlightRouter`) that stalled initialization boundaries.
- **Python Toolchain Binding**: Pinned the root workspace execution target cleanly to Python `3.12` using `uv python pin` to eliminate host configuration skew against global `3.11` fallbacks.
